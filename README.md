# trequant-website-v1
Trequant is a wearable which helps tremor patients analyze their tremors. 

Trequant's website was built using an off the shelf theme called Stamp. I introduced personal modifications to the theme to fit our use using 
SASS. The backend for the pre-order system is setup using Mailchimp. The website is hosted on Azure. Its score for both mobile and 
web view is 97% according to Google Analytics. 

The CSS was then combined and the final website result can be seen at http://www.trequant.com.
